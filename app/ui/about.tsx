            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Who You Are & What You Love: A short paragraph about your journey from music education to software development. It’s a conversation-starter and humanizes you.</p>
            <p>Optional Fun Facts or Interests: Keep it short, sweet, and relevant. E.g., mention your continuing involvement in marching band or an interesting pastime.</p>
            <p>Could incorporate a small Easter egg for the music side: maybe a subtle interactive note symbol or a playful twist—like a sprite that “marches” across the screen when hovered.
