            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>In 2020,  I traded in my conducting baton for a code editor. Since then, I&apos;ve had the privilege of coding a proprietary mobile application for a nationwide financial institution,  a solution to integrate and digitize patient health information and access with a health insurance agency,  and  led a pro-bono project
                for a local nonprofit.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I&apos;m not at my computer, I&apos;m typically finding a place to hike, hanging out with my pets, or helping teach the Beech Grove Marching Hornets.
            </p>
            <p>Any sufficiently advanced technology
                is indistinguishable from magic...
            </p>
            <p>Here are some tools I use to create that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>Express</li>
                <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                <li>Sequelize</li>
                <li>Heroku</li>
                <li>Netlify</li>
                <li>Git</li>
                <li>GitHub</li>
                <li>VSCode</li>
                <li>Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
